# Client Management System with Robust Database and UI Architecture
This project is a Client Management System designed to provide seamless interaction with a customer database. The application allows users to search, add, delete, and view detailed information about clients, all while ensuring efficiency and scalability through the use of key design patterns.

The Table Data Gateway pattern is utilized to encapsulate all database queries, ensuring that interactions with the database are streamlined and easy to maintain. By organizing SQL operations within specific gateway classes, the code remains clean, modular, and adaptable to future database changes.

To enhance performance and control over the database connection, the Singleton pattern is implemented, ensuring that only one instance of the database connection exists throughout the application's lifecycle, preventing resource conflicts and improving overall stability.

For the user interface, the project leverages the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern to separate the programâ€™s logic from the graphical interface, allowing for better code organization and a smoother user experience. This layered approach makes the system more maintainable, as UI updates or logic modifications can be done independently without affecting the other components.
